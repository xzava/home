# home
Sharing linux &amp; other config settings between devices


note: To any one looking to use these config, bash scripts, python files ect. Please read them first, they are set up for my system and may not work as expected on another file system. 

Also, if a script deletes anything it will be clearly labeled that it has the ability to do this.


Everything in this 'home' repo is public, you may do with it as your please. But a shoutout wouldn't hurt, backlink ect.
Everything in this repo is AS IS, no warranty or contract exists, any actions from this point are on your shoulders. Don't delete your filesystem by accident.

Signing off.
Keep looking at the sun, one day it will be home.

Mike.
